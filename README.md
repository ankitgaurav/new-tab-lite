# new-tab-lite
A minimalistic chrome extension to upgrade the new tab page in chrome :fire:
New Tab Lite is a simple lightweight solution for all those Google Chrome lovers who like the minimalistic interface of it but are always eager for some more.

With this extension installed you get the following features: :wink: :tada:
1. List of all recently bookmarked webpages on the top bar.
2. Speed dials for most frequently used sites (Yeah, you can opt to remove some as you wish ;) )
3. All the useful shortcuts in the laucher area just like Firefox. I know lots of folks hate the 3-dots option button in Chrome.

This extension is fully open source. Feel free to raise any issue or contribute to it.
