# Features:  :tada:
1. List of all recently bookmarked webpages on the top bar.
2. Speed dials for most frequently used sites (Yeah, you can opt to remove some as you wish ;) )
3. All the useful shortcuts in the laucher area just like Firefox. I know lots of folks hate the 3-dots option button in Chrome.
